# Former PGXPO Web API for the minecraft server
This collection of code represents the backbone of the PGXPO Minecraft server web API built on laravel during its prime.
It is the ***API*** used to get player info, leaderboards for games such as: Survival Games, PVP, etc.. , and search for players.
This repo has no migrations or anything, as I have worked with the developers and had direct access to Database schema.
While this project is now considered an artifact of the past, I have decided to release it to the public for nostalgic and educational purposes.
Although the code is not the cleanest but I believe I did a good job during that time and I hope anyone that you can learn or benefit from it.

Disclaimer:
This release is shared without active maintenance or support. It is presented as-is, and users are encouraged to explore, learn, and potentially find inspiration for their projects. I hope this snapshot from the past brings educational value to those who delve into its contents.
